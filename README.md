# Code Louisville - Sit, Stay & Play!
A website re-design for a local dog care service. Project requirement for Code Louisville Fall 2015, front end dev track.

A demo version of the website is available [here](http://andrewtyped.github.com)

# Key Features
- Framework-Free - All style provided by pure CSS (pre-processed by SASS), and
  all functionality by vanilla JavaScript.

- Responsive - Website maintains a professional look and feel across various
  viewports.

- Custom Lightbox - Used for navigation in mobile / tablet viewports, and for
  image display.

- Custom Image Carousel - CSS Transitions provide a novel method of browsing
  images.

- Accessible - Site is well-contrasted and fully navigable by keyboard. 

- Optimized - Navigation occurs strictly via AJAX so that scripts, styles, the
  navigation panel, and the footer are loaded only once during the lifecycle of
  a user's visit to the site.
